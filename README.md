# Scenario: Analyzing E-commerce Customer Behavior for Repeat Purchase Likelihood

- As an aspiring data analyst in our company’s analytics team, you have been tasked with producing a comprehensive analytical report that can be confidently presented to a Chief Data Officer (CDO) or Head of Analytics.

- Your goal is to demonstrate your ability to explore, clean, and analyze real-world business data to uncover actionable insights that help the company better understand its customers and drive strategic decisions — specifically around repeat purchase behavior.

- For this exercise, you have chosen the Online Retail Dataset — a transactional dataset containing approximately 500,000 records of purchases made between December 2010 and December 2011 by customers of a UK-based online retail store. The data includes detailed invoice-level information:
1. Invoice Number
2. Stock Code (Product ID)
3. Description
4. Quantity Purchased
5. Invoice Date
6. Unit Price
7. Customer ID
8. Country

# Focus
- The focus of your analysis is to identify factors that influence whether customers make repeat purchases, understand the buying behavior across different segments, and test hypotheses about patterns that can inform customer retention strategies.
